# pre-interview puzzle 1:
You are given a list of strings. In the list, each string has a power. The power of each string is calculated as follows:
`The number of characters // 2 + X`
Here, `X is 5 if the string is palindrome, else X is 1`
Your task is to **find the maximum difference in power** in the list.
Example:
`input: ['abc', 'acca', 'loki']`
`powers: [2, 7, 3]`
`maximum difference = 7 - 2 = 5`

# pre-interview puzzle 2:
Let's say you will be building a system that can **detect the price of a book** just from the front and back cover of the book. Users will upload pictures of books that they don't need now, your system will predict a baseline price of the book. Remember, you will only have images as input and old, torn, damaged books will be worth way less than books in perfect condition. Describe your end to end solution.
