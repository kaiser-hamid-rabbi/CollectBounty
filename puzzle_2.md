# Problem Statement:
Let's say you will be building a system that can detect the price of a book just from the front and back cover of the book. Users will upload pictures of books that they don't need now, your system will predict a baseline price of the book. Remember, you will only have images as input and old, torn, damaged books will be worth way less than books in perfect condition. Describe your end to end solution.

# Solution:
In this Machine Learning System Design problem, we have to build a Book Price Detection System from the book cover images. Steps are given below -

### 1. Data Collection:
- Gather a diverse dataset of book cover images from the front and back along with their corresponding prices. This dataset should cover various book genres, conditions (from brand new to damaged), and editions.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- Clean and preprocess the images to standardize them for model training. This step might involve resizing, normalization, and augmentation to handle variations in image quality, orientation, and condition.

### 3. Model Selection and Training:
- Choose a deep learning architecture suitable for image recognition tasks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Train the model on the training data to predict book prices from the cover images. Fine-tune the model to handle conditions like torn or damaged covers.

### 4. Evaluation:
- In order to evaluate this regression model's performance using the test set, we could use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure how accurately the model predicts book prices.

### 5. Deployment:
- Create an API using Flask or FastAPI or any other API making tools where users have to upload book cover images.
- Integrate the trained model into this interface to provide predictions based on the uploaded images.
Ensure the system handles edge cases like damaged or unclear images gracefully, possibly by incorporating image enhancement or denoising techniques.

This is an overview, and the specifics of each step would require more detailed planning, experimentation, and testing to create an effective end-to-end solution for book price prediction based on cover images.
